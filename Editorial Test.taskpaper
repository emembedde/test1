Edited locally test TaskPaper Mode:
Editorial 1.1 supports the .taskpaper Todo list format, invented by Hog Bay Software (http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper).
	
To create a task, type a line starting with a dash.
	- This is a task 
Tasks can be tagged, using the '@' symbol.
	- Another task @home 
The special @done tag is used to mark finished tasks.
	- A finished task @done(2014-08-26)
(Tags can contain additional information, like the completion date in parentheses.)

To insert a project header, simply type a line that ends with a colon (':'). Projects can also have tags.

Color Labels:
In Editorial's settings, you can associate tags with color labels. Some tags, like @due, @flagged, and @today have default colors, but you can easily change this.
	- This one is red @flagged 

	- This task should be blue  @today
	- Edited locally @now
	- Anothet line added THIS HAS NOW CHanged at 15:11
	- And another, can I only cmmit this line? NO this was also added why?
Tips:
You can rearrange tasks by dragging the right margin.
In the iPad version of Editorial, you can tap the checkbox next to a task to automatically add/remove the @done tag.
